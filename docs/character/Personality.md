# Inspiration
- Inspiration is a rule the Dungeon Master can use to reward you.
- By using inspiration, you can draw on your personality trait to give you an edge.
- You either have inspiration or you don’t. You can’t stockpile multiple “inspirations” for later use.

## Gaining Inspiration
Your DM can choose to give you inspiration for a variety of reasons.
- Play out your personality traits
- Give in to the drawbacks presented by a flaw or bond
- Otherwise portray your character in a compelling way.

## Using Inspiration
- If you have inspiration, you can expend it when you make an attack roll, saving throw, or ability check.
- Spending your inspiration gives you advantage on that roll.
- Additionally, you can give up your inspiration to give that character inspiration.
