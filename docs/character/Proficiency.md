# Proficiency Bonus
Your proficiency bonus applies to many of the numbers you’ll be recording on your character sheet:
- Attack rolls using weapons you’re proficient with
- Attack rolls with spells you cast
- Ability checks using skills you’re proficient in
- Ability checks using tools you’re proficient with
- Saving throws you’re proficient in
- Saving throw DCs for spells you cast (explained in each spellcasting class)

The table that appears in your class description shows your proficiency bonus, which is +2 for a 1st-level character.

Your class determines your:
- Weapon proficiencies.
- Saving throw proficiencies.
- Some of your skill and tool proficiencies.

Your background gives you additional skill and tool proficiencies, and some races give you more proficiencies.

- Your proficiency bonus can’t be added to a single die roll or other number more than once.
- Occasionally, your proficiency bonus might be modified (doubled or halved, for example) before you apply it.
- If a circumstance suggests that your proficiency bonus applies more than once to the same roll
or that it should be multiplied more than once, you nevertheless:
    - add it only once,
    - multiply it only once,
    - halve it only once.
