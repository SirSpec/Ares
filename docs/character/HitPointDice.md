# Hit Points and Hit Dice
Hit points define how tough your character is in combat and other dangerous situations.

Hit points are determined by your Hit Point Dice.

- At 1st level, your character has 1 Hit Die.
    - The die type is determined by your class.
- You start with hit points equal to the highest roll of that die(as indicated in your class description).
    - You also add your Constitution modifier. This is also your hit point maximum.
- Also record the type of Hit Die your character uses and the number of Hit Dice you have.
- After you rest, you can spend Hit Dice to regain hit points.
