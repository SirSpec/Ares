# Dice rolls
Dice are referred to by the letter d followed by the number of sides:
- d4, d6, d8, d10, d12, and d20.

Percentile dice, or d100, works differently: 
1. Generate a number between 1 and 100 by rolling two different ten-sided dice numbered from 0 to 9.
2. One designated die gives the tens digit, and the other gives the ones digit.
- 7 => 70 and 1 => 1 = 71.
3. Two 0s represent 100.

The rules tell you how many dice to roll of a certain type, as well as what modifiers to add. 

For example, 3d8 + 5: 
1. Roll three eight-sided dice
2. Add them together
3. Add 5 to the total.

# Round Down
Whenever you divide a dice roll, round down if you end up with a fraction, even if the fraction is one-half or greater.
- 0.3 => 0
- 1d3 => Roll d6 and divide by 2: 1 / 2 = 0.5 => 0
- 0.7 => 0
- 1.4 => 1
- 1.5 => 2
