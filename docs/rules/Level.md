# Level
- Character gains experience, represented by `experience points`.
- A character who reaches a specified experience point total `gains a level`.
- When a character `gains a level`, its class often grants additional features.
    - Increase your ability scores, either increasing two scores by 1 each or increasing one score by 2.
        - You can’t increase an ability score above 20.
    - In addition, every character’s proficiency bonus increases at certain levels.
- Each time you gain a level, you gain 1 additional Hit Die.
    1. Roll that Hit Die.
    2. Add your Constitution modifier to the roll.
    3. Add the total (minimum of 1) to your hit point maximum.
- Alternatively, you can use the fixed value shown in your class entry,
which is the average result of the die roll (rounded up).
- When your Constitution modifier increases by 1, your hit point maximum increases by 1 for each level you have attained.
- Class gains improvements at each level.

# Character Advancement
- A character typically begins with the minimum amount of XP required to reach that level.
- Levels are divided by tiers.
