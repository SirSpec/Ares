# Specific Beats General
If a specific rule contradicts a general rule, the specific rule wins.

# Dice rolls
Dice are referred to by the letter d followed by the number of sides:
- d4, d6, d8, d10, d12, and d20.

Percentile dice, or d100, works differently: 
1. Generate a number between 1 and 100 by rolling two different ten-sided dice numbered from 0 to 9.
2. One designated die gives the tens digit, and the other gives the ones digit.
- 7 => 70 and 1 => 1 = 71.
3. Two 0s represent 100.

The rules tell you how many dice to roll of a certain type, as well as what modifiers to add. 

For example, 3d8 + 5: 
1. Roll three eight-sided dice
2. Add them together
3. Add 5 to the total.

# Round Down
Whenever you divide a dice roll, round down if you end up with a fraction, even if the fraction is one-half or greater.
- 0.3 => 0
- 1d3 => Roll d6 and divide by 2: 1 / 2 = 0.5 => 0
- 0.7 => 0
- 1.4 => 1
- 1.5 => 2

# D20 roll 
There are the three main kinds of d20 rolls. 
- Ability checks
- Attack rolls
- Saving throws

All three follow these steps:
1. Roll a d20 and add the relevant modifier.
This is typically the modifier derived from one of the six [ability scores](./AbilityScores.md),
and it sometimes includes a proficiency bonus to reflect a character’s particular skill.

2. Apply circumstantial bonuses and penalties.
- Class feature
- Spell
- Particular circumstance
- ...or some other effect might give a bonus or penalty to the check

3. Compare the total to a target number.
- If the total equals or exceeds the target number, the ability check, attack roll, or saving throw is a success.
- Otherwise, it’s a failure.

# Target number
- Difficulty Class (DC) - The target number for an ability check or a saving throw.
- Armor Class (AC) - The target number for an attack roll.

# Advantage and Disadvantage
Advantage reflects the positive circumstances surrounding a d20 roll, while disadvantage reflects the opposite.

When you have either advantage or disadvantage:
1. Roll a second d20 when you make the roll.
2. Use the higher of the two rolls if you have advantage, and use the lower roll if you have disadvantage.

For example:
- If you have disadvantage and roll a 17 and a 5, you use the 5.
- If you instead have advantage and roll those numbers, you use the 17.
