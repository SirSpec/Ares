# Determine Ability Scores
## Randomly
1. Roll four d6 dice and record the total of the highest three dice.
2. Do this five more times, so that you have six numbers.
    - Variant: you can use the following scores instead: 15, 14, 13, 12, 10, 8.
3. Assign each number beside one of the six abilities scores.
4. Afterward, make any changes to your ability scores as a result of your race choice.
5. After assigning your ability scores,
determine your ability modifiers using the [Ability Scores and Modifiers](./AbilityScores.md) table.
6. Write the modifier next to each of your scores.

## Customizing Ability Scores
You can set ability scores individually.
1. You have 27 points to spend on your ability scores.
2. The cost of each score is shown on the [Ability Score Point Cost](./AbilityScores.md) table.
3. Using this method, 15 is the highest ability score you can end up with, before applying racial increases.
4. You canâ€™t have a score lower than 8.
