# Expenses
## Lifestyle Expenses
- They cover your accommodations, food and drink, and all your other necessities.
- Furthermore, expenses cover the cost of maintaining your equipment so you can be ready when adventure next calls.
- At the start of each week or month (your choice), choose a lifestyle from the Expenses table and pay the price to sustain that lifestyle.
- The prices listed are per day, so if you wish to calculate the cost of your chosen lifestyle over a thirty-day period, multiply the listed price by 30.

| Lifestyle    | Price/Day     |
|--------------|---------------|
| Wretched     | —             |
| Squalid      | 1 sp          |
| Poor         | 2 sp          |
| Modest       | 1 gp          |
| Comfortable  | 2 gp          |
| Wealthy      | 4 gp          |
| Aristocratic | 10 gp minimum |

## Self-Sufficiency
Maintaining this kind of lifestyle doesn’t require you to spend any coin, but it is time-consuming.
- If you spend your time between adventures practicing a profession, you can eke out the equivalent of a poor lifestyle.
- Proficiency in the Survival skill lets you live at the equivalent of a comfortable lifestyle.

## Food, Drink, and Lodging
The Food, Drink, and Lodging table gives prices for individual food items and a single night’s lodging.
- These prices are included in your total lifestyle expenses.
