# Equipment
## Starting Equipment
- Class and background determine starting equipment.
- You can purchase your starting equipment.
    - You have a number of gold pieces (gp) to spend based on your class.
    - If you wish, you can also have one trinket at no cost.
- Your Strength score limits the amount of gear you can carry.
    - Try not to purchase equipment with a total weight (in pounds) exceeding your Strength score times 15.

## Coinage
The three most common coins are
- the gold piece (gp)
- the silver piece (sp)
- the copper piece (cp)

In addition, coins made of other precious metals sometimes appear:
- The electrum piece (ep)
- the platinum piece (pp)

A standard coin weighs about a third of an ounce, so fifty coins weigh a pound.

## Selling treasure
Normally, you can sell your treasures and trinkets when you return to a town or other settlement.
- Arms, Armor, and Other Equipment.
    - As a general rule, undamaged weapons, armor, and other equipment fetch half their cost when sold in a market.
    - Weapons and armor used by monsters are rarely in good enough condition to sell.
- Magic Items
    - Selling magic items is problematic. The value of magic is far beyond simple gold and should always be treated as such.
- Gems, Jewelry, and Art Objects
    - These items retain their full value in the marketplace, and you can either trade them in for coin or use them as currency for other transactions.
- Trade Goods
    - Like gems and art objects, trade goods(bars of iron, bags of salt, livestock, and so on)
    retain their full value in the market and can be used as currency.

## Trade goods
It is measured in livestock, grain, land, rights to collect taxes, or rights to resources (such as a mine or a forest).

| Cost | Goods |
|------|-------|
| 1 cp | 1 lb. of wheat |
