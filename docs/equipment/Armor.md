# Armor and Shields
Armor Proficiency
- Your class gives you proficiency with certain types of armor.
- If you wear armor that you lack proficiency with, you have disadvantage on any ability check, saving throw, or attack roll that involves Strength or Dexterity, and you can’t cast spells.

Armor Class (AC)
- Armor protects its wearer from attacks.
- The armor (and shield) you wear determines your base Armor Class.
- Your Armor Class (AC) represents how well your character avoids being wounded in battle.
- Things that contribute to your AC include the armor you wear, the shield you carry, and your Dexterity modifier.
- Not all characters wear armor or carry shields, however.
Without armor or a shield, your character’s AC equals 10 + his or her Dexterity modifier.
- Your character needs to be proficient with armor and shields to wear and use them effectively,
and your armor and shield proficiencies are determined by your class.
- There are drawbacks to wearing armor or carrying a shield if you lack the required proficiency.
- Some spells and class features give you a different way to calculate your AC.
- If you have multiple features that give you different ways to calculate your AC, you choose which one to use.

Heavy Armor
- Heavier armor interferes with the wearer’s ability to move quickly, stealthily, and freely.
- If the Armor table shows “Str 13” or “Str 15” in the Strength column for an armor type, the armor reduces the wearer’s speed by 10 feet unless the wearer has a Strength score equal to or higher than the listed score.

Stealth
- If the Armor table shows “Disadvantage” in the Stealth column, the wearer has disadvantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks.

Shields
- A shield is carried in one hand.
- Wielding a shield increases your Armor Class by 2.
- You can benefit from only one shield at a time.

Variant: Equipment Sizes
- Using this variant, when adventurers find armor, clothing, and similar items that are made to be worn, they might need to visit an armorsmith, tailor, leatherworker, or similar expert to make the item wearable.
- The cost for such work varies from 10 to 40 percent of the market price of the item.
- The DM can either roll 1d4 × 10 or determine the increase in cost based on the extent of the alterations required.

Light Armor
- If you wear light armor, you add your Dexterity modifier to the base number from your armor type to determine your Armor Class.
    - Padded
    - Leather
    - Studded Leather

Medium Armor
- If you wear medium armor, you add your Dexterity modifier, to a maximum of +2, to the base number from your armor type to determine your Armor Class.
    - Hide
    - Chain Shirt
    - Scale Mail
    - Breastplate
    - Half Plate

Heavy Armor
- Heavy armor doesn’t let you add your Dexterity modifier to your Armor Class, but it also doesn’t penalize you if your Dexterity modifier is negative.
    - Ring Mail
    - Chain Mail
    - Splint
    - Plate

## Getting Into and Out of Armor
The time it takes to don or doff a type of armor or a shield is shown in the Donning and Doffing Armor table.

Don
- This is the time it takes to put on the item
- You benefit from its AC only if you take the full time to don it.

Doff
- This is the time it takes to take off the item
- If you have help removing armor, reduce this time by half.
